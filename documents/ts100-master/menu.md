# Menu System


## Soldering mode

In this mode the iron works as you would expect, pressing either button will take you to a temperature change screen.
Use each button to go up and down in temperature. Pressing both buttons will exit you from the temperature menu (or wait 3 seconds and it will time out).
Pressing both buttons or holding the button near the USB will exit the soldering mode.
Holding the button at the front of the iron will enter boost mode (if enabled).

## Settings Menu

This menu allows you to cycle through all the options and set their values.
The button near the USB cycles through the options, and the one near the tip changes the selected option.
Note that settings are not saved until you exit the menu.
If you leave the unit alone (ie don't press any buttons) on a setting, after 3 seconds the screen will scroll a rough description of the setting.

The menu is arranged so that the most often used settings are first.
With submenu's being selected to enter using the front button (as if you were going to change the setting).
Scrolling through the submenu will return you back to its entry location after you scroll through all of the options.

### Calibrating input voltage

Due to the tolerance on the resistors used for the input voltage divider, some irons can be up to 0.6V out on the voltage measurement.
Please calibrate your iron if you have any issues with the cutoff voltage.
Note that cutoff messages can also be triggered by using a power supply that is too weak and fails under the load of the iron.
This is more critical than before with the new cell count based cutout voltage.

To calibrate your iron:

1. Measure the input voltage with a multimeter and note it down.
2. Connect the input to your iron.
3. Enter the settings menu
4. Under the advanced submenu
5. Select the calibrate voltage option
6. Use the front and back buttons to adjust the displayed voltage to minimize the error to your original measurement
7. Hold both buttons to save and exit to the menu

### Tip Model Selection

The menu now lets you select which tip you are using with your iron. This lets the unit know which gain value to use for your tip, this varies slightly between models and can help with temperature accuracy.
There is also an option for a *custom* tip. This basically means that you will tune the tip parameters yourself.

### Calibrating tip offset (Set tip model)

Some tips will have an offset on their readings, to calibrate this out perform the following steps:

1. Connect power to your iron
2. Make sure the tip is at room temperature (ie. wait for a fair while after using the iron before calibration)
3. Enter the settings menu
4. Scroll down to the advanced menu, and then the temperature calibration
5. Press the button to change the option (tip button)
6. The display will start to scroll a warning message to check that the tip is at ambient temperature!
7. Press the button near the tip of the iron to confirm
8. The display will go to "...." for a short period of time as the unit measures the tip temperature and the handle temperature and compares them
9. The display will then go back to *TMP CAL*
10. Calibration is done, just exit the settings menu as normal
11. You're done, enjoy your iron!

### Calibration of custom tip

There are two methods to calibrate the tip, the simple mode which requires boiling water, and an advanced mode that requires a method of measuring the actual tip of the tip.

Advanced mode is preffered.

In simple mode you first need to have the tip at room temperature to start, and then when prompted place the tip into a cup of boiling water, wait a few seconds and then press a button to confirm.

In advanced mode, follow instructions on the screen, you will need to adjust the ranges to find two calibration points by measuring the tip temperature directly. This tends to be significantly more accurate.

If you do calibrate your own values for a tip because it's missing from the menu or because you think the one in the menu is really wrong, raise an issue on github and I'll be happy to look at adding it or revising the existing settings.


### Boost mode

This allows you to change the front key (one near the tip) to become a boost button when you hold it for > 2 seconds. This allows you to set this button to change the soldering temperature for short periods. For example when soldering a big joint and you want to boost the temperature a bit.

The boost temperature is set in the settings menu.

# Translation
If you would like to contribute a translation, use the [Translation Editor](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/blob/master/Translation%20Editor/TranslationEditor.html).

[Open a reference language file and optionally a target language file](https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/tree/master/Translation%20Editor).

You can create a pull request with the new / updated json configuration file, and this will include this language into the new builds for the firmware.

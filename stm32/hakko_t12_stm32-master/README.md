Revision history

11/16/2019

Fixed incorrect message processing issue.
    Now "EEPROM read error" message would be displayed in case if the controller cannot access EEPROM IC.
Empty slot for TIP calibration data issue fixed. The slot of non-active tip can be used for newly activated tip.
    When new tip activated, the controller checks data written to EEPROM.
If tip configuration data would not read correctly the "EEPROM write error" message would be displayed.

Tip connection issue has been fixed.
Capacitor C8 has been removed from schematics.

11/05/2019
